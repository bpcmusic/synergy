#Taking Apart the Synergy

Followed the instructions in the "DK-1 Operating System V 2.42 - Installation" document for the diassembly; presenting a shortened version here with a little more detail on the things that I did during the process.

OPENING THE CASE

1. Balance the Synergy on its Back Panel - always hold carefully with one hand. It doesn't feel like it wants to stand there on its own.
2. Using a #3 screwdriver - remove the 4 screws marked "A"
3. Place the Synergy bottom-down and slightly overhang the keyboard over the edge of your workspace
4. Come under the Synergy and using a #3 screwdriver, remove the two screws marked "B"
5. Using a #2 screwdriver, remove the two screws marked "C"
6. *Do not do anything crazy after this point like tilting the Synergy - the keyboard is completely unsecured (except for a fragile little ribbon connector)*
7. Gently lift the top of the Synergy (above the Keyboard) using the two end blocks on either side of the keyboard.

REMOVING THE KEYBOARD

1. Remove the ribbon connector from the upper right of the keyboard; do it carefully and "DO NOT PULL ON THE WIRE" (quoting the aforementioned document). It suggests using a flathead screwdriver - I used needlenose pliers.
2. Get a helper to hold the top of your Synergy - in the next step you remove the keyboard assembly, which causes a lot of weight to leave the base of the keyboard. Mine wanted to tip over - hence the helper.
3. Put a few things adjacent to the boards in the base of your Synergy to balance the weight with the top. I used 10 lbs of padded hand weights way at the front - which was just about enough.
