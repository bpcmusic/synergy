#Sticky Buttons
---

There are seven switches on my Synergy that are sticking and requiring that they be pulled upwards to unlatch.

* Sequencer - Even Switch (1 Red)
* Transpose Switch (1 Black)
* Voices: 1, 2, 10, 16, 17 (5 Black)

The voices buttons are tricky as they prohibit their vertical pair from being recognized when stuck in a down state.

Need to repair 6 Black and 1 Red switches.
