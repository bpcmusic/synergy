#Keyboard Refurbishment

The plan:

* Change out the Bushings
* Clean the Keys
* Cross Fingers that No Actuators Break

There is a "universal keyboard upgrade" that you can find on the [Virtual Music site](http://virtual-music.at/webseiten_e/zubehoer/dk.htm). I reached out to Alexander Guelfenberg at Virtual Music about getting his upgrade and found it wasn't offered for the Synergy anymore. Here is what he shared with me:

	All items were fitting when I had my personal Synergy. And I saw that all PPG parts worked for that. But then a client told me that his knobs are quite different so they did not fit.

I should point out that he is an insanely nice person and 

####Bushings


While everything is taken apart, I'm going to use this opportunity to change out the Rubber Key Bushings for the Pratt-Read keyboard assembly. The Synergy has 74 keys - I purchased a few extra from Syntaur:

At the time of this writing, they were $0.70 USD per bushing. 

Here are some videos that I've been researching before I open her up:

I'll put notes about my disassembly and assembly when I get to it here. 



####Cleaning the Keys

Going to try a little dish soap here.

####Key Actuators

Mine are all good right now; hope that I don't break any in the process. If so - I'll have to model them in OpenSCAD and 3D print replacements. If I do, I'll share the STL and SCAD files here.
